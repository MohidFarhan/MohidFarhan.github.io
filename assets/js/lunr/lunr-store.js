What we like to call “empty” is teeming with activity and fluctuations at the quantum scales. This is not just theory, but has measurable consequences, all of which we will get into...","categories": ["Quantum Field Theory","Relativistic Quantum Mechanics","Particle Physics","Atomic and Molecular Physics"],
