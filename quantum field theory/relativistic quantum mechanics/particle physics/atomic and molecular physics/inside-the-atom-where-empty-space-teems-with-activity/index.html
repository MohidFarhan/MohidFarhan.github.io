        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Today we set out to unravel one of the most counterintuitive facts in all of physics: that <em>empty space is not empty at all</em>. What we casually refer to as “nothing” is, in reality, a restless arena of quantum activity and fluctuations. These are not just speculative ideas born in abstract theory but have very real and measurable consequences. One of those consequences is the subject of this post, and as we work our way into it you will see that even a simple hydrogen atom becomes a window into the deepest layers of reality. You will need knowledge on introductory Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the atom was a hot topic for physicists in the early 1900s, with J.J Thompsons famous “fruitcake” model, where the atom was assumed to be a smooth and filled sphere of positive charge, with clumps of negative charges embedded in it. In 1911, Earnest Rutherford devised the most accurate atomic model known to man, backed by an experiment, where a minority of alpha particles were observed to scatter off at large angles when targeted at a thin foil of gold. This showed that an atom was mostly empty space with a lot of its mass being concentrated at the center, leading to such dramatic scattering. This center with positive charge is known as a nucleus, with much lighter negative electrons orbiting around it.</p>

<h2 id="the-empty-space-inside-the-atom">The Empty Space Inside the Atom</h2>

<p>Now that we objectively know that most of the atom is empty space, let’s make estimations to quantify this emptiness. The Rutherford model predicts the radius of the atom to be of the order \(r_a \approx 10^{-10}m\) and of the nucleus to be \(r_n \approx 10^{-15}m\). Comparing the ratio of their volumes:</p>

\[\frac{\frac{4 \pi (r_a)^3}{3}}{\frac{4 \pi (r_n)^3}{3}}=\frac{r_a^3}{r_n^3} \approx (\frac{10^{-10}}{10^{-15}})^3 m\approx 10^{15}m\]

<p>This tell us that the atom is almost completely empty. To  give you an idea of the magnitude of this ratio, its like if the atom was the size of a football field, the nucleus would be a cherry placed in its center. Now, let’s dive into the deep end. If I claimed that there is no such thing as empty space, that what is actually going on in that space?</p>

<p>To understand this, we will view the atom from the lens of Quantum Field Thoery (QFT).</p>

<h2 id="the-behaviour-of-the-electrons">The Behaviour of the Electrons</h2>

<p>In the classical treatment of the atom, the electrons should spiral into the nucleus while radiating energy and ultimately the atom should collapse in picoseconds assuming that it is purely a particle. However, in the quantum mechanical treatment, it is assumed to be a wave, in the sense that all of its information is inscribed in its wavefunction $\psi$, which can be computed by solving the Schrodinger equation:</p>

\[\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r} \right] \psi = E \psi\]

<p>This \(\psi\) acts like a probability that is distributed throughout empty space, which do not locate the electron exactly, but rather give the probability of where we are likely to find it. As it turns out, the resulting $\psi$ leads to discrete energy levels which keep the atom stable, and the electrons energy constant, with different energies corresponding to different shells. While all this points to the fact that empty space is not truly empty due to a probability being smeared all across it, the real game-changer is the addition of special relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="particles-in-a-contracting-box">Particles in a Contracting Box</h2>

<p>One can intuitively picture the atom as a small sphere, which contrains the particles confined within it. To understand the dominance of quantum effects, let’s analyze the example of a particle in a contracting box.  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the smaller the uncertainty in position, the larger the uncertainty in momentum and vice versa.</p>

\[\Delta p \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\]

<p>So if an electron is constrained to a small enough space, relativistic effects become dominant. In such a case, the energy is given by:</p>

\[E=\Delta pc=mc^2\]

\[\frac{\hbar c}{2\Delta x}=mc^2\]

\[\Delta x=\frac{\hbar}{2m_ec} \approx 10^{-12}m\]

<p>It becomes apparent that this length is bigger than the radius of the nucleus but smaller then that of the atom, hence making the “empty” space inside the atom an ideal environment for effects to occur. So, we have seen that in the case of an atom, the electron can be confined to a region where the quantum mechanical picture becomes fuzzy. Beyond this, ordinary quantum mechanics breaks down, and we require another way to understand the atom. This is where Quantum Field Theory (QFT) can play a part, but do not be overwhelmed by the fancy name…it is a lot more simple than it sounds. In the QFT interpretation, fields are fundamental, not particles. Particles are simply localized excitation in fields that permeate through space. Using QFT allows us to study the atom from a field perspective, which aids in making sense of the situation. In order to detect the consequences of the restless empty space on atomic energies, we need to determine a consequence of these quantum effects. To detect QFT’s effects, we first need to establish what happens without them.</p>

<h2 id="the-picture-without-qft">The Picture Without QFT</h2>

<p>Let’s pick the simplest case here: the ground state Hydrogen atom, with an electron orbiting a proton. The well known ground state energy of the Hydrogen atom is given by solving the Schrodinger equation mentioned earlier , and turns out to be:</p>

\[E = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m_e e^4}{(4\pi \varepsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2}=-13.6 eV\]

<p>The full derivation of this is the topic for another blog, but for now, trust me on this. Note that this is the picture without QFT, since the Schrodinger equation is non-relatvistic, as explained in the first blog of this series. For the confined particle, if we take the assumption that \(\psi\) vanishes at the edges, the allowed wavelengths are given by:</p>

\[\lambda_n=\frac{2L}{n}\]

<p>The edges (where probability disappears) are called modes, which have distinct spatial and temporal frequencies. n is an integer value and L is the length of the constraining box. The wavenumber k (spatial frequency) is given by \(k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}\), which results in:</p>

\[k=\frac{\pi n}{L}\]

<p>Expanding into 3 dimensions, we get the spatial frequency vector:</p>

\[k=\frac{\pi}{L}(n_x,n_y,n_z)\]

<p>The temporal frequency, on the other hand, is given by:</p>

\[\omega_k=2 \pi f=\frac{2 \pi c}{\lambda}=kc\]

<h2 id="the-qft-treatment">The QFT Treatment</h2>

<p>In QFT, each mode is treated as a quantum harmonic oscillator and the minimum energy in such a case is, unlike classical oscillators, non zero due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The minimum energy of each mode is given by: 
\(E_{min}=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}\)</p>

<p>So we can see that by incorporating QFT, these modes that make up the vacuum give rise to vacuum energy, due to quantum fluctuations. This bold prediction is made possible by the QFT treatment. Analyzing the effect due to one mode, we combine the previous 2 equations to get:</p>

\[E_{min}=\frac{\hbar\omega_k}{2}=\frac{\hbar ck}{2}\]

<p>According to Maxwell equations of Electromagnetism, the energy density of a mode k is given by:</p>

\[u=\frac{\epsilon_0|\epsilon_k|^2}{2}\]

<p>\(\epsilon_k\) is the root mean square amplitude of the electric field associated with k. Note that the magnetic field is not mentioned since its weaker than the electron field by a factor of c, the speed to light. The energy is simply the product of energy density and volume. Assuming our confining box has length a, we get:</p>

\[E_{vac}=ua^3=\frac{\epsilon_0|\epsilon_k|^2a^3}{2}\]

<p>We can, now, equate \(E_{vac}\) with \(E_{min}\) in a semi classical approximation to get:</p>

\[\frac{\epsilon_0|\epsilon_k|^2a^3}{2}=\frac{\hbar ck}{2}\]

<p>Though this is a semi-classical approximation, ultimately it leads to the same result. The resulting root mean square of the electric field amplitude of a mode is:</p>

\[|\epsilon_k|^2=\frac{\hbar ck}{\epsilon_0 a^3}\]

<p>So the vacuum electric field amplitude associated with mode k is given by:</p>

\[\epsilon_k=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar ck}{\epsilon_0 a^3}}\]

<p>We now observe, from the QFT perspective,  that every mode trembles with its own electric field. Note that in QFT, there are infinite amount of modes and each one contributes its own effects, in a vacuum, oblivious to the presence or absence of particles. Now the idea of empty space, not being empty starts to make sense, but we are not finished. Each mode within the Hydrogen atom, influences the electron, not by much alone, but the effects add up. This also changes the probability distribution of the electron, and this is something we can pick up despite its subtlety.</p>

<h2 id="the-lamb-shift">The Lamb Shift</h2>

<p>This subtle change in the electrons probability distribution leads to a shift in its energy levels, in what is referred to as “The Lamb Shift”. If you bear with me a little longer, we can get into how we can quantify it for our Hydrogen atom. Let’s first study the shift caused by one mode, with spatial wave-vector k and frequency $\omega_k$, on an electron. The force experienced by the electron due to an electric field is given by:</p>

\[F=m_ea=e\epsilon\]

<p>So the acceleration caused by a mode k is given by:</p>

\[a_k=\frac{e\epsilon_k}{m_e}\]

<p>The time period of the oscillation of mode k is given by:</p>

\[T_k=\frac{2\pi}{\omega_k}\]

<p>The time where the field pushes the electron in one direction is half of this time period (picture a pendulum):</p>

\[\tau=\frac{\pi}{\omega_k}=\frac{\pi}{ck}\]

<p>The displacement ($s_k$) caused due to a mode is given by:</p>

\[s_k=\frac{a_k\tau^2}{2}\]

\[s_k=\frac{e\epsilon_k\pi^2}{2m_ec^2k^2}=\frac{e\pi^2}{2m_ec^2k^2}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar ck}{\epsilon_0 a^3}}=\frac{e\pi^2}{2m_e c^2 k^{3/2}} \left( \frac{\hbar c}{\varepsilon_0 a^3} \right)^{1/2}\]

<p>Now we can calculate the summed up effects on displacement, doe to all the modes. Since these modes are not correlated with each other, we can sum the mean square displacement. The summation takes the following form over k-space:</p>

\[s^2=\sum_k (s_k^2)\]

<p>Taking the continuum limit over k-space gives us:</p>

\[s^2=\sum_k (s_k^2)=\frac{a^3}{(2\pi)^3}\int_k(s_k)^2d^3k\]

<p>The factor \(\frac{a^3}{(2\pi)^3}\) arises due to the density of states in k-space, which factors in for the step-size of k and allows the sum to take the form of an integral. Since we are dealing with a spherical atom, it is useful to use spherical coordinates where:</p>

\[d^3k=4\pi k^2dk\]

<p>We can now sub in $d^3k$ and $s_k$ to give us an integral in terms of k.</p>

\[s^2=\frac{a^3}{(2\pi)^3}\int_k \left( \frac{e\pi^2}{2m_e c^2 k^{3/2}} \left( \frac{\hbar c}{\varepsilon_0 a^3} \right)^{1/2} \right)^2 4\pi k^2dk\]

<p>Simplifying gives:</p>

\[s^2=\frac{\pi^2\hbar e^2}{8m^2\epsilon_0c^3}\int_k\frac{1}{k}dk\]

<p>If we are not careful, and integrate from zero to infinity, we could get unphysical answers. Therefore, we are going to integrate over the cut-off limits, since not all modes can interact with the electron. We deploy the IR-UV (Infrared-UltraViolet) cutoffs, since modes smaller than the IR modes are have wavelengths too high to perturb the electron and modes greater than the UV modes, have wavelengths that are too small compared to the atoms, which means that the idea of small perturbations on the electrons no longer apply. We define the cutoffs as:</p>

\[k_{UV}=\frac{1}{\lambda_c}, \quad k_{IR}=\frac{1}{a_0}\]

<p>where \(\lambda_c=\frac{\hbar}{mc}\) is the Compton wave length which we derived earlier and $a_0$ is the Bohr radius.</p>

<p>Which gives us the integral:</p>

\[s^2=\frac{\pi^2\hbar e^2}{8m^2\epsilon_0c^3}\int_{k_{UV}}^{k_{IR}}\frac{1}{k}dk\]

<p>Performing the integration yields:</p>

\[s^2=\frac{\pi^2\hbar e^2}{8m^2\epsilon_0c^3}In\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\]

<p>where, remarkably, \(\alpha\) is the fine structure constant and is of the form:</p>

\[\alpha=\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0\hbar c}\approx\frac{1}{137}\]

<p>which is the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. This constant is baked into nature and thecfact that it pops up here also, is a very encouraging sign that we are on the right track. This is the beauty of physics, where the mathematics magically leads you to the most fundamental constants in nature. The average displacement registered by the electron can be computationally derived through simulations, the details of which we will not get into in this blog, and it turns out to be:</p>

\[\bar{s}=\frac{s^2}{3a_0}\]

<p>To determine the energy shift on the Hydrogen atom, we begin by considering the potential:</p>

\[V(r)=\frac{-e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r}\]

<p>Factoring in the perturbation of the electron yields, by the Taylor Expansion:</p>

\[V(r+s)=V(r)+s\frac{dV}{dr}+...\]

\[V(r+s)=V(r)+s\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r^2}+...\]

<p>The second term on the left hand side is the energy due to the perturbation, and is, precisely, what we are looking for. So letting $r=a_0$ (the most probable value of r) gives us:</p>

\[\Delta E=s\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0a_0^2}\]

\[\Delta E=\frac{s^2}{3a_0}\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0a_0^2}=\frac{e^2s^2}{12\pi \epsilon_0a_0^3}\]

<p>Using the $s^2$ relation derived earlier gives:</p>

\[\Delta E=\frac{e^2}{12\pi \epsilon_0a_0^3}\frac{\pi^2\hbar e^2}{8m^2\epsilon_0c^3}In\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\approx5 \times10^{-5} eV\]

<p>Note that every single quantity in this expression is a known constant, and so plucking in all the constants gives you a reasonable order-of-magnitude value the change in energy due to empty space not being actually empty. Although this energy is a million times smaller than the ground energy of of Hydrogen which was stated earlier, it is a measurable change which acts a undeniable and irreputable proof that the vacuum is far from empty: it always jitters and its fingerprints are real and measurable. So we just proved by both theory and experiment, that even empty space, when quantized to a small enough scale, gives rise to fluctuations. If you constrain something to a small enough volume, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle allows it to acquire enough energy to produce particle-anti particle pairs.</p>

<p>I hope you learned something new from today’s blog, and I will be back soon with another interesting topic.</p>
