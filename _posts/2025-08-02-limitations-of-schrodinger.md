## Introduction
Welcome to this blog series where the objective is to spread science and make difficult concepts digestable. The content of this blog is for an audience familiar with basic Quantum Mechanics and concepts of matrices. I will show you that with such basic tools, one can track all the way back to the founding equation of particle physics which governs our universe. 

The well-known SchrÃ¶dinger equation is given by:

 $i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) =
  \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}, t) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) -----------(1) $                     

This equation is a cornerstone of Quantum Mechanics. It provides accurate predictions for many atomic and molecular systems. In essence, it is an energy conservation equation which states the total energy of a particle (left hand side of 1) is the sum of its kinetic energy (first term of right hand side) and potential energy (second term of right hand side), in the form of Quantum Mechanical operators. It is a first order partial differential equation, which means that once the wavefunction $\psi(r,t)$ is known, we can easily determine the evolution of the particle using:

 $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)=\psi(\mathbf{r}, 0)e^{-\frac{iHt}{\hbar}}-----------(2)$

The probability density for the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is given by squaring the wavefunction:

$\rho(r,t)=|\psi(r,t)|^{2}-----------(3)$

## The Continuity Equation for the SchrÃ¶dinger Equation
---
We begin with the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation:

\[i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right)\psi\]

Taking the complex conjugate:

\[
-i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right)\psi^*
\]

Multiply the first by \( \psi^* \) and the second by \( \psi \):

\[
\psi^* i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \psi^*\left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V\psi \right)
\]

\[
\psi (-i\hbar) \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial t} = \psi\left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi^* + V\psi^* \right)
\]

Subtracting:

\[
i\hbar \left( \psi^* \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \psi \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \psi^* \nabla^2 \psi - \psi \nabla^2 \psi^* \right)
\]

The left-hand side becomes:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\ps

## The Klein-Gordon Equation

Starting from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

$$
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 \tag{7}
$$

Promoting energy and momentum to operators:

$$
E \rightarrow i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}, \quad \mathbf{p} \rightarrow -i\hbar \nabla
$$

Applying these to $\psi$:

$$
(i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t})^2 \psi = \left[ (-i\hbar \nabla)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 \right] \psi
$$

Simplifying:

$$
- \hbar^2 \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = \left[ -\hbar^2 c^2 \nabla^2 + m^2 c^4 \right] \psi
$$

Rewriting:

$$
\left( \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \right)\psi = 0 \tag{8}
$$

## Continuity Equation for Klein-Gordon

Repeat the steps as before, using product and conjugate rules. Eventually, the continuity equation becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0
$$

Where:

$$
\rho = \frac{2mc^2}{i\hbar} \left( \psi^* \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} - \psi \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial t} \right) \tag{9}
$$

$$
\mathbf{j} = \frac{2m}{i\hbar} ( \psi \nabla \psi^* - \psi^* \nabla \psi ) \tag{10}
$$

But here, $\rho$ can be **negative**, violating the interpretation of probability. Klein-Gordon, while Lorentz invariant, breaks down physically.

## Dirac's Ingenious Insight

Paul Dirac proposed a **linear form** of the energy relation:

$$
E = (\alpha_x p_x + \alpha_y p_y + \alpha_z p_z)c + \beta mc^2 \tag{11}
$$

Squaring both sides and comparing with Eq. (7) reveals **constraints** on $\alpha_i$ and $\beta$:

- $\alpha_i^2 = 1$, $\beta^2 = 1$
- $\{ \alpha_i, \alpha_j \} = 0$
- $\{ \alpha_i, \beta \} = 0$ â€ƒfor $i \neq j$

These cannot be scalars. Pauli matrices (2Ã—2) fail. But **4Ã—4 matrices** work:

### The Dirac Matrices

These matrices satisfy all constraints:

- $\alpha_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \sigma_x \\ \sigma_x & 0 \end{pmatrix}$  
- $\beta = \begin{pmatrix} I & 0 \\ 0 & -I \end{pmatrix}$

Using these, the Dirac Equation becomes:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -i\hbar c (\alpha_x \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \alpha_y \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} + \alpha_z \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}) + \beta mc^2 \psi
$$

Or in covariant form using natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$):

$$
(i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi = 0 \tag{22}
$$

## The Gravity of Diracâ€™s Work

The Dirac equation incorporates **spin**, **anti-particles**, and **Lorentz invariance**. The 4-component spinor solution elegantly predicts particles like the **positron**, confirmed shortly after Diracâ€™s proposal.

But...

## The Big Problem in Nuclear Physics

Despite all progress, **the strong force** remains analytically unsolved. Its strength is about 137 times that of EM, making perturbative approaches useless:

$$
\alpha_{EM} \approx \frac{1}{137}
$$

At $\alpha \geq 1$, the perturbation series diverges. Current workarounds include:

- **Lattice QCD**: numerical spacetime grid simulations  
- **Effective Field Theories**: low-energy approximations  
- **QCD Sum Rules** and **AdS/QCD**

None provide closed-form solutions.

> ðŸŽ¯ **A Nobel Prize likely awaits whoever cracks this problem.**

Until then, we rely on experiment.

## What's Next?

The Dirac equation is not the end. Quantum Field Theory, Gauge Symmetries, and unification of interactions lie ahead. But first, letâ€™s get comfortable with the implications of what Dirac built â€” and how deep this rabbit hole goes.

Stay tuned.
