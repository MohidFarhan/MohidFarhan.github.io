## Welcome to My Physics Blog

I'm **Mohid Farhan**, a physics graduate with a fond interest in the frontiers of cosmology and particle physics, and an interst in making duanting physics concepts more accesible to the general public by using intuition to stitch pieces together. This blog serves as a foundation to a youtube channel in the future, and these posts combine rigorous physics with approachable explanations, from quanntum field theory to cosmology.
