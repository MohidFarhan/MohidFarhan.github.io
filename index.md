## About Me

I'm **Mohid Farhan**, a **Presidentâ€™s Gold Medalist** in Physics with a deep interest in the frontiers of cosmology, particle physics and GUT.  
I aim to make complex physics concepts more accessible by using intuition to connect ideas and reveal the bigger picture.  
This blog lays the groundwork for a future YouTube channel and combines rigorous physics with approachable explanations, from quantum field theory to cosmology.
