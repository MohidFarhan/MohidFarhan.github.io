## About Me

I'm **Mohid Farhan**, a **Presidentâ€™s Gold Medalist** in Physics with a passion for understanding the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest cosmic structures.  
My research interests lie in **cosmology**, **particle physics**, and the **unification of fundamental forces (GUTs)**.

I enjoy translating complex physical theories into intuitive explanations that bridge the gap between abstract mathematics and conceptual understanding. I am actively involved in conferences and research, currently working towards **incorporating dark matter and dark energy** under a single theoretical framework, with the vision of contributing to what I consider the most important area of physics, the **Grand Unification Theory**.

This passion inspired me to start this blog, a space where I explore topics ranging from **quantum field theory** and **relativity** to **astrophysics** and **cosmology**, with the aim of making these seemingly abstract subjects more accessible to curious minds. This blog serves as a foundation to a YouTube channel (coming soon), where I plan to make video-form educational content and continue to pursue my goals: not only to contribute to physics at the highest level, but also to communicate it and inspire like-minded individuals to use it as a catalyst for prosperity and development.
Once my research is published, I will present the findings here in a digestible form. The goal is to help others engage with the deep questions driving modern physics.

Beyond academics, I strive to create societal change through science. I have undertaken leadership roles in several events (such as **World Space Week**), societies (including **IDS**), and NGOs (like **UMEED**).  
I have also presented my work at multiple scientific conferences and continue to seek opportunities to share and communicate science. Alongside my research, I am currently employed as a **teaching resource at The City School**, which keeps my passion for teaching alive and active.
